***Description of how the workload was distributed***
We decided it would be more beneficial for this project to attempt to do all
work on it together. Meeting multiple times and working on various sections
of the project together. There was preliminary work done by Courtney to make
implementation easier and polishing the project for submission was done by Jacob.

***Description of how well the workload was upheld be each member of the team***
When beginning the project Courtney did some work to setup each of the .cpp files
as well as creating a makefile to make compilation easier. Jacob was responsible for 
creating javadoc comments, testing the final implementation of all files, and
submitting the final version of the project.
