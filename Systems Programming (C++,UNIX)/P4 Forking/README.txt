#Project 4
***Both student names and 810***
Jacob Maraffi 811-571-598
Courtney Hogan 811-049-994

***Description of how the workload was distribued***
A large portion of the project was done together. Courtney was responsible for the size
program as well as the makefile, both created before peer-programming work began. Newer and
dirlist were done as a group as well as testing for those programs. Jacob was responsible for
the forkpid program and this README that was done after the peer-programming work.

***Description of how well the workload was upheld by each member of the team***
Both members completed all that was expected of them for this project, in terms of the 
distributed work as well as the projects specifications. No problems were encountered when 
it came to the workload.
