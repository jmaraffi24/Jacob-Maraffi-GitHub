Reed Sexton was responsible for the initial implementation of the sorting methods and
collecting the data on the different sorting algorithms for the report. Both partners 
collaborated when testing the sorting methods in regards to their implementation, fixing errors
within the code and finalizing the main method. Jacob Maraffi took care of the implementation of the 
Sorting.h header file, as well as the necessary documentation for the Sorting.cpp, Main.cpp and Sorting.h files.
The report was tackled by both partners with Reed collecting the initial data for the complexity analysis 
and doing the grammar checking and logic checking once Jacob put together the body of the report.
